# Analysis about the study

## Researchers

- Stephan Eliez
- Cameron Carter
- Valentina Mancini

## Published in? When?

- Elsevier, June 30 2020

## General topic

- Auditory hallucinations, which are one of the common symptoms of schizophrenia, could be caused by an increment of the number of connections in the brain, between the areas in charge of of language-processing and in charge of of sensory 

## Procedure/what was examined

- Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the researchers compared brain structures and their connectivity in 110 healthy control subjects and in 120 subjects with a genetic disorder
- The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging to compare the brains of 110 control subjects to the brain's connectivity of 120 subjects with a specific genetic disorder which increase the risk of developing schizophrenia 
- Investigations on brain scans of subjects aged from 8 to 35

## Conclusions/Discovery

- The study showed that the thalamic nuclei (which is involved in the process of sensitivity) presents an abnormal development 
- We also see immature patterns in the thalamo-cortical's connections with the areas in charge of of the auditory 
- The geniculate nuclei is smaller in people with the specific genetic disorder studied
- The thalamic nuclei is larger in people with the specific genetic disorder studied (than in the healthy control group)
- The subjects with the specific genetic disorder present a greater connectivity between the  medial geniculate nucleus (MGN), the areas in charge of auditory and areas in charge of language-processing. This hyperconnectivity could explain the appearance of hallucinations 

## Remaining questions

Dr. Mancini's words :"Further, the investigation of the developmental interactions between the thalamus and the cortex may help to identify new targets for intervention aimed at preventing the emergence of psychotic symptoms."
