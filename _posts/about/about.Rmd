Hello ! 

I am Sarah Verrart, I study biology in 2nd year of bachelor at Umons. My English teacher's name is Ingrid Van Lancker, and my data sciences' teachers are Philippe Grosjean and Guyliann Engels. 

This blog presents a category named "English for Science" which mainly discusses neurological diseases, my portfolio's subject. The English for Science category also contains a post called "My English Activity Log : MEAL".

The blog also includes a "Data Science" category which contains more specific works for the Biological Data Science lesson.
