I learned a lot while doing this work. 

I was especially surprised to learn that we could spot Alzheimerâ€™s disease with a simple blood test until twenty years before the appearance of first symptoms, with 96% of accuracy ! 

I hope that this kind of preventions will be more developed and accessible for people in the following years. Neurological diseases stay a curse for millions of people around the world, and scientists are doing their best to pursue the research.
